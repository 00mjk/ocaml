Warning 8: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a value that is not matched:
((Some _, None)|(None, Some _))
val f : 'a option * 'b option -> int = <fun>
#             type _ t = A : int t | B : bool t | C : char t | D : float t

Warning 4: this pattern-matching is fragile.
It will remain exhaustive when constructors are added to type t.
