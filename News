OCaml 4.07.0 (10 July 2018):
----------------------------

Some highlights of this release are:

-   The way the standard library modules are organized internally has
    changed (GPR#1010, by Jérémie Dimino):

    1. the `List` module (for example) is now named `Stdlib__list`
    2. a new Stdlib module contains a series of aliases
    such as `module List = Stdlib__list`
    3. the `Stdlib` module is implicitly opened when type-checking OCaml
    programs (as `Pervasives` previously was), so that `Stdlib.List` can be
    accessed as just `List`, as before.

    This should be invisible to most users, although it is possible that
    some tools show the `Stdlib.` or `Stdlib__` prefixes in
    messages. (You might want to report these situations as usability
    bugs.) The change prevents standard library modules from conflicting
    with end-user filenames (please avoid `stdlib.ml` and the
    `Stdlib__` prefix); we may introduce new standard library modules in
    the future with less fear of breaking user code. In particular,
    `Float` (GPR#1638, by Nicolás Ojeda Bär) and `Seq` (GPR#1002, by
    Simon Cruanes) modules have now been added to the standard library.

-   The error messages caused by various typing errors have been improved
    to be easier to understand, in particular for beginners.
    (GPR#1505, GPR#1510, by Arthur Charguéreau and Armaël Guéneau)

    For example,

        # while 1 do () done;;
                ^
        Error: This expression has type int but
               an expression was expected of type bool

    now adds the extra explanation

        because it is in the condition of a while-loop

-   Effort has been made to reduce the compilation time of flambda
    programs, and the size of the produced `.cmx` files when using
    the -Oclassic optimisation level.
    (GPR#1401, GPR#1455, GPR#1627, GPR#1665, by Pierre Chambart, Xavier
    Clerc, Fuyong Quah, and Leo White)

-   The HTML manual has benefited from various style improvements
    and should look visually nicer than previous editions.
    (GPR#1741, GPR#1757, GPR#1767 by Charles Chamberlain and steinuil)

    The new version of the manual can be consulted at
    <http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.07/>; see the
    previous version for comparison at
    <http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.06/>.

-   Since 4.01, it is possible to select a variant constructor or
    record field from a sub-module that is not opened in the current
    scope, if type information is available at the point of use. This
    now also works for GADT constructors.
    (GPR#1648, by Thomas Refis and Leo White)

-   The GC should handle the accumulation of custom blocks in the minor
    heap better; this solves some memory-usage issues observed by code
    which allocates a lot of small custom blocks, typically small bigarrays
    (GPR#1476, by Alain Frsich)

OCaml 4.06.1 (16 Feb 2018):
---------------------------

This release consists mostly of bug fixes. The most salient bugs were

-   An incorrect compilation of pattern-matching in presence of
    extensible variant constructors (such as exceptions), that had been
    present for a long time.
    (GPR#1459, GPR#1538, by Luc Maranget, Thomas Refis and Gabriel Scherer)

-   An optimization of `not (x = y)` into `x <> y`, introduced in
    4.06.0, is incorrect on floating-point numbers in the `nan`
    case. (GPR#1470, by Leo White)

See the detailed list of fixes at (Changes#4.06.1).
