To build ocamlc from source code, at directory /contracts

$./configure
$make world

To test contract checking with some small examples, you can download examples from 

http://gallium.inria.fr/~naxu/research/testcontracts.tar.bz2

[I assume directories /contracts and /testcontracts are at the same level ]

$tar -jxvf testcontracts.tar.bz2
$cd testcontracts
$make all

If you put testcontracts in other directories, please change the first line in
/testcontracts/Makefile, i.e. 

OCAMLDIR=../contracts

to point to the newly generated ocamlc. 

To run the generated bytecode files at /testcontracts, e.g. do

$./basic

If it gives error msg saying bad interpreter /usr/local/bin/ocamlrun, 
you can link it to where you installed your ocamlrun by linking, e.g.

$ln /usr/local/bin/ocamlrun /usr/bin/ocamlrun
